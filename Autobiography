      <h2>Early Life</h2>
      <p>
        I grew up in a relatively quiet but friendly neighborhood, which also has it's fairshare of problems.
        It was interesting to say the least, playing with the kids on a hot saturday morning, or listening to old radio stations,
        most of all, it was the most interesting part of my life, free of worries and constant pressures.
